# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
This project was to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. The Vine program for the toy department was analyzed to see if the program had an effect on reviews. 

## Results: 
- How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
There were 1266 vine reviews and 62028 non-vine reviews
- How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
There were 432 5 star vine reviews and 29982 non-vine reviews
- What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
34% of the vine program otes were 5-stars and 48% of the non-vine votes were 5-stars

## Summary: 
There was no positivity bias for the Vine reviews, it was actually the opposite for the toy department with most 5 star reviews from the non-vine reviews. Another possible analysis would be to filter for verified purchases to determine if that made any difference in the number of 5-star reviews.
